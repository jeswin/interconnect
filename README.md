# border-patrol

A service which does oauth authentication and issues a JWT token.

## Installation

1. Install via npm.

```sh
npm i -g border-patrol
```

2. Create a postgres database and create the tables with scripts found under the 'db' directory.

## Running

You'd use something like this.

```sh
(export PORT=5999 CONFIG_DIR=/some/path/to/config; border-patrol)
```

Where:

- PORT is the port on which the service will run.
- CONFIG_DIR is the directory in which config files are placed.

An example directory containing config files (which are JS files) can be found under the 'example-config' directory.
This is where you specify database connection strings, jwt signing keys etc.

## Authenticating

Send the browser to {YOUR_DOMAIN}/authenticate/{OAUTH_SERVICE}?success=SOME_URL&newuser=OTHER_URL. For example: www.example.com/authenticate/github?success=example.com/success&newuser=example.com/newuser.
The page will redirect to example.com/success if the authenticated user is found in the database, and to example.com/newuser if the authenticated user is not found in the database.
